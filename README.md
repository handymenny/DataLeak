## Data Leak

This Android APP scans the app installed on your device to identify those potentially involved in an alleged Gravy Analytics data leak.

It uses data shared by [Hudson Rock (@RockHudsonRock)](https://x.com/RockHudsonRock/status/1876970787351007724) and [Baptiste Robert (@fs0c131y)](https://x.com/fs0c131y/status/1876985446930043048).

The check is completely offline, the app isn't even allowed to access internet.

All the code in this repo is covered by [MIT licence](LICENSE), while the data doesn't have a license.

Thanks to the researchers who extracted and shared the list of apps :)

The icon is a random icon created by an AI, ignore it \:D
